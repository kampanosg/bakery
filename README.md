[![Pipeline](https://github.com/kampanosg/bakery/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kampanosg/bakery/actions/workflows/go.yml)

Bakery is an (opinionated) alternative to the popular [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) tool. It uses YAML instead of a custom syntax and provides handy defaults, such as `help`, `version` and `metadata`. Its main goal is to make the developer experience more familiar and friendly while being fast and reliable.
